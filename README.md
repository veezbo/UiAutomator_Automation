Automated UiAutomation
============

This project contains two scripts, though you'll only ever have to use the Python script.

Basically, it automates the entirety of the UiAutomator pipeline, from creating the test with the android command, to building it, to pushing it to the device, and finally to running it.

Furthermore, you can run as many UiAutomator projects at once as you wish.

Usage
-----------
Also Provided in the Program

    python UiAutomator.py -p <PROJECT_PATHS> -c <PACKAGE_NAMES>

(Don't ask about the -c argument; it's Android's convention)
